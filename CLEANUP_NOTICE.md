# Cleanup Notice - Project Restructuring

## 📁 Old Frontend Folder

The `frontend/` folder is now obsolete as all frontend files have been moved to the root directory.

### ✅ **What Was Moved:**

- `frontend/src/` → `src/`
- `frontend/package.json` → `package.json` (merged)
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` → `vite.config.ts`
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` → `tailwind.config.js`
- `frontend/tsconfig.json` → `tsconfig.json`
- `frontend/index.html` → `index.html`
- `frontend/.env` → `.env`

### 🗑️ **Safe to Remove:**

The `frontend/` folder can be safely removed as all its contents have been copied to the root level.

**Note:** The old folder is kept for reference during deployment testing. It can be removed once deployment is confirmed working.

### 📋 **New Workflow:**

All development now happens in the root directory:

```bash
# Old way (NO LONGER NEEDED)
cd frontend && npm run dev

# New way 
npm run dev
```

This simplifies the development workflow and makes deployment much easier.
