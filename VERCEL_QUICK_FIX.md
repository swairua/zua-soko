# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Quick Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Function Runtime Error

**Problem**: `Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version`

**Solution**: Updated `vercel.json` to use modern Vercel defaults

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Before (Problematic):
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x",
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build:prod",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Deploy Again Now

1. **Trigger new deployment** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Or push new commit** to trigger auto-deployment
3. **Build should now succeed**

## 🛡️ Backup Options

If the simplified config doesn't work, use `vercel.alternative.json`:

```bash
# Rename the alternative config
mv vercel.alternative.json vercel.json
```

## ✅ Expected Results

- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ API functions auto-detected by Vercel
- ✅ Static files served from `dist/`
- ✅ All routes properly configured

## 📱 Test After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Try logging in with: `+254734567890` / `password123`
3. Test the marketplace and farmer dashboard
4. Verify API endpoints are working

The deployment should now work perfectly! 🎉
